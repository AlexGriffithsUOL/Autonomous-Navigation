Initialise slam, map and robot variables
	Need to use the navigation stack
	Keep a saved list of the colours and their status



Look around for the nearest coloured pole,
	Create 4 masks, strict red and yellow, relaxed on the green and blue
		Turn around
		Check the list of colours and status
			Create masks of image (exclude any that have been excluded)
		Bitwise AND them together
		once located create contours
		move towards largest



if found mark it on map
	have a set distance away (0.5-1m)
	if blocked etc attemp to explore towards it 
	once there		
		Mark its location on the map
		Mark it as excluded
else
	explore unexplored areas,
		Look at spanning trees etc
repeat until all 4 are excluded (found)



once all 4 of the poles have been found calculate the fastest route using a*
	navigation stack



follow the route while actively performing slam to avoid obstacles
	check that the poles are in the same place
	if not then mark them as finding
		repeat steps to create a route



Needs to perform slam and obstacle avoidance throughout
